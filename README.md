# PromoPilot: Ecommerce Campaign Insights
Seasonality, segments, and category prioritization for smarter spend.

Data-driven strategy pack to rev up your e-commerce campaigns with clear, defensible insights:
- **Seasonality** → Acquisition kickoff in **Nov/Dec** and push through **Mar** (peak in **Mar**); **Retention** focus in **Feb–Mar**. Run **summer promotions** to counter the dip.
- **Audience** → Emphasis on **<18** and **40–49** segments; maintain both genders since acquisition/retention rates are similar while female tends to drive higher net sales.
- **Products** → Lead with **Jeans**, **Accessories**, **Tops & Tees**; de-prioritize **Maternity**, **Suits**, **Socks & Hosiery**.
- **Regions** → Weight **USA** (CA, TX, NY, IL, FL) and **UK** (Birmingham, Leeds, Leicester, Glasgow, Sheffield).
